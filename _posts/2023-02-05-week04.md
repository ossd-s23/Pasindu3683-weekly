Disclaimer : I joined the class following week 2, so this blog post will cover all the material from the start-it will be categorized week by week

Week 1:

I signed up for this course in order to not only gain a better understanding of open source, but also the need for it and the ways in which it can contribute to the forward movement of software/computer science as a whole. During my time at AWS, where we worked on all private software, I wondered why any major corporation would make their source code public (like PyTorch and Tensorflow). The major lessons I learned is that Open Source isn't just a category of software, but it is a whole movement backed by the philosophy that software should be free and filled with a community of contributors working towards a common goal.

I do believe, however, that there are indeed downsides to open source, and there is a place for open source, but it is not always. Obviously major corportations that are profitting off of their software should have closed source software, but there are some downsides beyond these scenarios which I thought of. For example, running a large open source project is similar to operating an organization-theres always going to be issues and hitting heads on which direction the software should move towards-politics always shows up. Aditionally, there could be a wide variety of coding and design styles on a large scale project even though there is an agreed upon system.

Overall, I definitely do believe Open Source Software brings on more good than harm-it gives a community infinite potential to create and collaborate on software which will be substantial for centuries to come.

Week 2:

The Go programming language (which I had no idea was open source) had a very neat code of conducts page. It goes over the values (such as being respectful, thoughtful, charitable, responsible, constructive, etc). I absolutely agree with the values that they provide, but part of me feels like this should apply to all open source projects and shouldn't have to be written out-instead, it should be part of a common licnese (MIT, etc). 

Seeing that this Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, the main differences I see are in how Go somewhat expanded every section to give a more detailed and precise view of conduct as well as add an aditiona section for Conflict Resolution. I believe the main point of this was due to software culture for Go specifically. Even though I mentioned this should be part of a standard license, I do acknowledge that every organization/project has their individual values and ways of dealing with certain things, such as conflicts in this example. Eclipse's code of conduct, which is also adapted from Contributor Covenant, is different in some ways. Eclipse has a higher set of enforcement and "laws". For example, they give mentions of bad behavior types as well as a no retaliation andammendmants section. Similarily, the Sugar Labs code of conduct is much more plain and less exagerated-it provides more of a general outlook on good values.
