Disclaimer : I joined the class following week 2, so this blog post will cover all the material from the start-it will be categorized week by week

Week 1:

I signed up for this course in order to not only gain a better understanding of open source, but also the need for it and the ways in which it can contribute to the forward movement of software/computer science as a whole. During my time at AWS, where we worked on all private software, I wondered why any major corporation would make their source code public (like PyTorch and Tensorflow). The major lessons I learned is that Open Source isn't just a category of software, but it is a whole movement backed by the philosophy that software should be free and filled with a community of contributors working towards a common goal.

I do believe, however, that there are indeed downsides to open source, and there is a place for open source, but it is not always. Obviously major corportations that are profitting off of their software should have closed source software, but there are some downsides beyond these scenarios which I thought of. For example, running a large open source project is similar to operating an organization-theres always going to be issues and hitting heads on which direction the software should move towards-politics always shows up. Aditionally, there could be a wide variety of coding and design styles on a large scale project even though there is an agreed upon system.

Overall, I definitely do believe Open Source Software brings on more good than harm-it gives a community infinite potential to create and collaborate on software which will be substantial for centuries to come.
