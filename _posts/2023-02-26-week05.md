Week 5 

During Week 5, we were albe to hear Mek Karpeles talk about the wonders of open source software as well as his work, which was extremely interesting. I find it almost noble how Mek is devoting his time and career to a good cause, which is to essentially convert all print to digital access. But more than the mission, I feel that Open Library's intentions are much more important-to spread open source impact and create an environment to contain everything in the area of texts. Normally, my friends and I all had a commmon goal getting into computer science-to get into FAANG and break into the big-tech industry, which is mostly all closed software. However, from what I have learned in this class, I understand the mission of open source much better, and it is very honorable how Mek and others like him are devoting themselves towards a genuine goal like this rather than just chase wealth.
