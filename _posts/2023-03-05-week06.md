title: Week 6

This week, I got the chance to explore a lot of cool open source projects. I've been thinking a lot about what kind of open source project 
I want to contribute to for the main group project. It is really hard to choose because there a lot of big and fascinating projects like Kubernetes and tensorflow
but there are also some smaller humanitarian projects which I feel would benefit more from our contributions. Another area which I've been considering, based on
the taking stock assignment is the resources and contribution level I can provide-I noticed that a lot of the humanitarian projects which I've seen are written 
in more front end languages such as javascript, css, etc. However, my whole life I've only coded in C++, Java, and Python (mainly). If I choose a humanitarian project
which I feel like would excite me the most, I feel like the biggest challenge would be getting more familiar with the front end side of things. On the other side, a 
lot of the bigger projects like Kubernetes have lots of Python and C++ available. So right now, I am currently trying to find a go-between of finding a project
where I can make a reasonable impact and also one where I am familiar with the language and frameworks. I plan to overcome this by hopefully becoming more 
familiar with front end things like Javascript leading up to the project.
