title: Week 7 - First Week of Project
---

This week was particularily interesting because we were given our groupmates and the time to actually get to know one another and choose a project to contribute to

### Choosing a Project
I was told I was arbitrarily added to this group because I had no common projects with others from the survey. However, I am very happy I was put in this group as we were all in agreement of the type of contributions we want to make. Most of us had basically no experience in front end development, so we were all in agreement to stick to something along the lines of Python/Java. At first, we started to look at humanitarian projects because we wanted to choose a project that made a good impact on the world. But it was a huge dissapointment because we quickly realized that basically all of the humanitarian projects we analyzed as well as the ones on the class list were mainly written in front end languages like CSS/HTML/Javascript/PHP/etc. While doing this, we definitely found some really cool aspects of GitHub, such as many projects having a label on issues tagged as “good for beginners”, “5 minute fix”, or something along those lines. Once we expanded our horizons beyond humanitarian projects, we ran into this project called Jarvis, which is a personal assistant for linux (including Mac) and windows that runs on the terminal. We agreed that this was a project that had a lot of potential for contributions and the latest commits were recent enough that there would be an active enough community.
