### Jim Hall and OpenDos

When the Professor first asked us if we knew what DOS meant, I immediately assumed she meant Denial Of Service, and I realized later on that a lot of my classmates did as well. I remember DOS and DDOS from my high school minecraft days. Back to the topic, I was suprised by how kind Jim seemed to be. My first thought was, what is the point of FreeDOS? As it seemed to be an open source project that was mainly meant to do things like run legacy software and play DOS games, as it says on the website. I liked Jim's discussion of starting the project and how his code was bad in the beginning (self-addmittedly), so that definition gives us some hope! I also really enjoyed his discussion of the conversion to 64 bit, as a question I had (which I asked) was what the future of open source will look like as we convert to more modern artchitectures. Overall, I really enjoyed his talk and it really brings into light the history of what itwas like back in the day with his story of microsoft and DOS. I hope that one day I can be as passionate about soething like Jim is about FreeDos.
