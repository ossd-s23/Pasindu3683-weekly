### Cathedral and the Bazaar
I enjoyed learning about the different development types brought up in the text: the cathedral model and the bazaar model. Both of the models have their benefits and downfalls. For example, the Bazaar model is good in how it releases early, often, which gives the ideals of listening to the users to develop better. There's some downfalls to this-what if releasing so often gives a bad public image to the product, making it seem it is often still in development with millions of bugs? And also, how often would a user have to update? What if a new update isn't compatible with a plugin (,etc) of its applications. As many people agreed on, whether to use the Bazaar model often depends on what we are building (maybe it isn't the best approach for software runnning on Project Kuiper's satellites).
