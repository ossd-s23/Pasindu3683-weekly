### Christopher Snider and Tidepool
It's worth noting first of all that I was plesantly suprised by how passionate and involved Snider was about Tidepool. A lot of the open source speakers we have tend to be very enthusiastic but you can tell Snider is on a whole new level due to his personal connection due to diabetes. Monitoring the news over the last couple years, I realized that healthcare is a very sensitive area, especially when you try to mix in software-there is a huge upside when everything goes right, but a lot can easily go wrong. When you consider that this software, Tidepool, can literally affect peoples lives, it makes you really appreciate the level of effort and dedication that went into its development. Being the source of all data in which a diabetes patient makes their decisions is no small responsiblity. Reading about Tidepool prior to the talk, I was wondering what sort of development standards are set when developing a software of this caliber, as a small bug could result in a large emergency, or even death, to some users. Snider answered this when he talked about their circular sprint process, where they go through multiple cycles before releasing. One thing I would be/am concerned about regarding Tidepool is that it is indeed Open Source-meaning it could very well be susceptible to data leaks or hacks that could produce catastrophic disasters. But on the other hand, thereâ€™s a lot of good people to balance out the bad-which means more people to keep and eye not the code and find any ways to improve it and make it secure-this is the constant upside of open source, as we have learned throughout the semester. Overall, it was very inspirational to hear the history of the product and how they started out with a simple glucose pump which people ran some source code with.
