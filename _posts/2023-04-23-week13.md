### Open Source Business Models and use of Open Source in Business


One of the main points I got from this presentation is that Open Source itself isn't a business model, but there are models that are built around open 
source. Specifically, I read Tom Callaway's article on "musings on open source software business models". It was interesting how even open source based software
companies can offer such a wide variety of service models such as donation, subscription, SaaS, FUD, etc. However, although the company is based around open
source, Tom highlights how the main focus of any company should be to provide value to customers, as well as the open source community in this case. Open Core, as
discussed in the class presentation is also a intriguing method-keeping the core of the project open source, while keeping addons and improvements prorietary,
meaning pay to acquire. I noticed that although not open source, a lot of popular game companies these days are releasing games that are free to play, but 
have purchasable in game accessories or items. It seems like this is working because games like this, such as Warzone and Fortnite, have been massively
succesful over the years. I thought Software Consulting was rather weird, as in your helping a company implement open source into their operations. There is 
absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I felt as if it is very specific and niche compared to the other methods discussed. But ofcourse the rest (Saas, donations,
subsription models) all make sense and are widely used and understood.
