title: Week 15 - Our Presentation and Wrap-Up
---
We presented our Jarvis project and listened to other groups' projects

### Jarvis
I was extremely happy with everything-our project contributions, Jarvis as a whole, how our presentation went, and even more, the time I spent with my groupmates this semester. I could not have asked for a better group. I worked with some very collaborative and skilled people and we were able to get everything done to our satisfaction. I can truly say I'm proud of the work we got done. Diving deeper into the contributions, not all of our PRs have been accepted yet, but we are very happy with the modifications we have made. The presentation went very well-all of us were able to talk about our respective contributions as well as the overall consensus of the project. 

### Others
I was also very happy to see other peoples' presentations. I really enjoyed learning about these new projects, especially Oppia and Sci-kit learn.
