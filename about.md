Hi! My name is Pasindu and I am a third year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math. I interned as a software engineer at AWS (Amazon Web Services) last summer in Seattle working on the Platform org. Following graduation this summer, I am returning to Amazon as a software engineer working on Project Kuiper in the New York office.
